# Big Data Retail Assignment

## Problem Definition
This project addresses large-scale retail transaction analysis using Big Data technologies
to support data-driven decision making.

## Dataset
Retail Store Dataset  
Source: https://github.com/futurexskill/bigdata

## Cloud Environment
- Platform: Google Cloud
- Service: Dataproc
- Storage: Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- Processing Engines: Apache Spark, Hadoop MapReduce

## Implementation
- Spark was used for data ingestion, transformation, and Parquet storage.
- Hadoop MapReduce (Streaming API) was implemented for batch aggregation tasks.

## Results
- Spark successfully processed over 1 million transactions.
- Hadoop MapReduce jobs were executed and analyzed; execution logs and counters are provided.

## Repository Structure
- spark/: Spark processing scripts
- mapreduce/: Mapper and Reducer implementations
- results/: Execution outputs and logs
